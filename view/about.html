    <h1>A little bit about me</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Miryam, I come from Tunisia, and I (am king of the hill, a number one!!!!) work as a Junior developer for a startup
        in Munich, Germany. I have been writing code passionately since 2006, and professionnaly since 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
            Not so long ago, I passed that threshold where I learned enough about software to realize that I knew nothing about software.
            Among others, attending Conferences and Meetups around software development played an important role in this outcome.
            <br/> However, hearing seasoned professionals talk with both passion and humility about their learning path, and how they
            overcame their own challenges has strongly inspired me to learn more, and to try things for myself. Moreover, it
            pointed me in the right direction and helped me decide what to focus my efforts on. </p>
    
        <p>
            This year my main focus was high quality code and web technologies. So I read uncle Bob's Clean Code, took the OCA exam,
            and got a copy of Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I also switched to a new company
            where I have the chance to work with more modern tools, like Spring, AngularJS and Neo4j. I am now surrounded by
            a team of very experienced developers from whom I am learning so much and who inspire me every day to become a better
            developer myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Altough I do not imagine turning into a software architect next year, it is important to me to understand the fundamentals,
            as well as recent trends of software architecture. This allows me to grasp more quickly the decisions made in my
            company, and pehaps be able to be one step ahead when it comes to implementation.
