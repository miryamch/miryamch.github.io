<h1>What this scholarship means to me</h1>

        <p>
            Not so long ago, I passed that threshold where I learned enough about software to realize that I knew nothing about software.
            Among others, attending Conferences and Meetups around software development played an important role in this outcome.
            <br/> However, hearing seasoned professionals talk with both passion and humility about their learning path, and how they
            overcame their own challenges has strongly inspired me to learn more, and to try things for myself. Moreover, it
            pointed me in the right direction and helped me decide what to focus my efforts on. </p>
    
        <p>
            This year my main focus was high quality code and web technologies. So I read uncle Bob's Clean Code, took the OCA exam,
            and got a copy of Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I also switched to a new company
            where I have the chance to work with more modern tools, like Spring, AngularJS and Neo4j. I am now surrounded by
            a team of very experienced developers from whom I am learning so much and who inspire me every day to become a better
            developer myself.

            Altough I do not imagine turning into a software architect next year, it is important to me to understand the fundamentals,
            as well as recent trends of software architecture. This allows me to grasp more quickly the decisions made in my
            company, and pehaps be able to be one step ahead when it comes to implementation.

  <!-- I strongly believe in knowledge sharing, and I am proud to be part of an industry where
    the advancement of the general quality and common standards comes before individual success. 
    I am also proud to be in one of the most progressive industries when it comes to diversity. Yes, the software industry is 
    far from being diverse at the moment, but I find that in comparison to others, I find it to be one of the loudest about 
    this topic and where people are 
    To my own surprise, -->
