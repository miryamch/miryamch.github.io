This is a static website created as a support for my application to the 
[O'Reilly's scholarship](https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/diversity-application.csp)
to go to the [Software Architecture conference](https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-ny) 
in New York in February 2019. 

I used this great tutorial as a starting point: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ 

The resulting website can be visited here: https://miryamch.github.io/
