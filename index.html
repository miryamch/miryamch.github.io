		<p>
			I created this website for you to get to know me better and to show you a bit of my world. It should give you an overview
			of my professional and personal ambitions, and my motivation to attend the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in
			February 2019.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because I mostly worked on proprietary software in the last years, I am unfortunately unable to share with you the fun projects
			that I contributed to. But I still wanted to show you something, so I invested some of my free time to work on this project.
		</p>
		
		<p>
				I hope you enjoy it!

				chance to attend the conference. I'm sure she'll bring back lots of exciting and valuable ideas for the team."

				"We at CRX are notoriously picky in our recruiting activities. 
				The fact that Miryam was the first junior developer who found place in our team of hardcore IT geeks speaks for itself. 
				But there is more to it: Miryam raises new discussion topics, brings new ideas, and makes everyone smile at least 3.14 times more often than before. 
				Basically, she is the definition of the term Diversity for our team."
