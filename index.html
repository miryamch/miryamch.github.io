			I created this website for you to get to know me better and to show you a bit of my world. It should give you an overview
			of my professional and personal ambitions, and my motivation to attend the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in
			February 2019.

			that I contributed to. But I still wanted to show you something, so I invested some of my free time to work on this project.

		<p> This is actually my first personal website, and to me, seeing it go live was already a victory in itself. But if

					can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere!
				</a>
			</span> were granted the O'Reilly Diversity Program Scholarship it would encourage me to take action more often!
