	<h1>Hi there, I'm Miryam!</h1>
	<p> Okay I admit it, until now I didn't have any (finished) project to show you. Truth is, I constantly have ideas for websites
		and apps that I'd like to write in my free time, but I never went through any of them. </p>

	<p> This is why I decided to create this website just for you! To me this is already a victory in itself, and I would like to
		thank you for that. But going to the Software Architecture Conference on February 2019 in New York with your help would
		mean a lot, and encourage me to take action more often!
