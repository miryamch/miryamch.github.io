		I have created this website for you to get to know me better and to show you a bit of my world. 
		It should give you an overview of my professional and personal ambitions,  
		and my motivation to attend the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in February 2019.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because I mostly worked on proprietary software in the last couple of years, I am unfortunately unable 
		to share with you the fun projects that I contributed to. 
		But I still wanted to show you something, so I used some of my free time to work on this side project. 
	</p>

	<p> This is actually my first personal website, and to me, seeing it go live was already a victory in itself. 
		But if I were granted the O'Reilly Diversity Program Scholarship it would encourage me to take action more often!
