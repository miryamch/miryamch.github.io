			I created this website for you to get to know me better and to show you a bit of my world. It should give you an overview
			of my professional and personal ambitions, and my motivation to attend the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference in
			February 2019.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because I mostly worked on proprietary software in the last years, I am unfortunately unable to share with you the fun projects
			that I contributed to. But I still wanted to show you something, so I invested some of my free time to work on this project.
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope you enjoy it!
