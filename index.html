			<h1>Hi there, I'm Miryam!</h1>
			<p> Okay I admit it, until know I didn't have any (finished) project to show you.
				<br/> Truth is, I constantly have ideas for websites and apps that I'd like to write in my free time, but I never went through
				any of them.
				<br/> This is why I decided to create this website just for you!
				<br/> To me this is already a victory in itself, and I would like to thank you for that.
				<br/> But going to the Software Architecture Conference on February 2019 in New York with your help would encourage me to
				take action more often!  
			</p>
